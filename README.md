# MPS_Phase-Learning
Learning Phases of Matrix Product States (MPS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository is as simple as that. Calculating ground states with DMRG for MPS and then using them to train a CNN to recognize its phase.
New here is on one side the capability to use bigger quantum many body systems as compared to exact diagonalization but more importantly: transfer learning from smaller to bigger system sizes.
